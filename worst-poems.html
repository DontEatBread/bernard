    <h2>The Ballad of the Missing Sock</h2>
<p>My sock is gone, where could it be?
It wasn’t on the floor, I see.
I checked the drawer, I checked the chair,
But there’s no sock, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>I looked inside the laundry bin,
No sock, no sock, where have you been?
Did you escape? Did you run away?
Why won’t you come back to me today?</p>

<p>Oh, sock, you’ve left me all alone,
My foot is cold, I’ll never be whole.
Now I walk with only one,
A barefoot journey has begun.

    <h2>The Epic of the Apple</h2>
<p>An apple fell, it hit the ground,
It made a noise, it made a sound.
It rolled away, I chased it fast,
But I couldn’t catch it, not at last.</p>

<p>I picked it up, it was so red,
But then I dropped it, onto the bed.
I thought about it, for a while,
But now I’m bored, and I don’t smile.</p>

<p>I ate the apple, it was so sweet,
But now my stomach has a seat.
The apple’s gone, it’s all done now,
I wonder what I’ll eat next, anyhow.</p>

    <h2>The Tale of the Rubber Duck</h2>
<p>The rubber duck floats in the tub,
With a little squeak, it’s a tiny nub.
I watch it float, it’s kind of neat,
But then it’s stuck under my feet.
</p>

<p>
It bounces up, it bounces down,
It makes a sound, a little frown.
I wish it could just go away,
But it’s here with me, every day.
</p>

<p>
The rubber duck is yellow and round,
It doesn’t really make a sound.
It’s just there, not much to say,
But it keeps me company in a strange way.
